### About the Project ###

This is one of the labs in Professional C++ class.

The basic idea is that there are zombies and humans fighting for dominance a post-apocalyptic zombie world. Rather than hard-coding the behavior of the zombies and humans, their behavior is off-loaded to “.zom” files. So for instance, “daryl_dixon.zom” is a pretty awesome ranged/melee zombie killer while “michonne.zom” only does melee attacks.

I selected this project to submit it as code example because it covers many C++ specific technologies, including file parse, std::exceptions, object-oriented design and implementation, and GUI using wx API's.

Feel free to view all my other projects in this Github.
